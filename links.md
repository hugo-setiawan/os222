### LINKS

1. [Linux in 100 Seconds (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrB13utjYV4)<br>
I think this is an excellent video that explains, in an interesting and quick manner, what Linux (as an OS) is and able to do, as well as some basic commands such as *ls, pwd, du*, and many others. 
If you're totally new to Linux, i believe this is an excellent first video to watch (besides, it's only 3 minutes long!).  
2. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/)<br>
RegExr is (in my opinion) a great place to learn and practice one's Regular Expression (RegEx) skills. 
The website allows you to create RegEx, see how it is parsed, and test it against your input.
