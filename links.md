#### W00
1. [Linux in 100 Seconds (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrB13utjYV4)<br>
I think this is an excellent video that explains, in an interesting and quick manner, what Linux (as an OS) is and able to do, as well as some basic commands such as *ls, pwd, du*, and many others. 
If you're totally new to Linux, i believe this is an excellent first video to watch (besides, it's only 3 minutes long!).  
2. [What is an Operating System as Fast as Possible (by Techquickie)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzRTmdd9j0)<br>
This video does a quick dive into what an OS generally does, like managing hardware and providing system calls.
In a sense, this video is able to summarize a bunch of concepts which are important in an OS into one, 5 minute video.
I recommend watching this to get a stronger grasp of the basic concepts.

#### W01
1. [Regular Expressions (RegEx) in 100 Seconds (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQxhojSdZM)<br>
Another video made by Fireship which i think explains the what a RegEx is and some basic syntax in a quick and easy to understand manner.
Although this video doesn't dive very deep into RegEx syntax, I still think it is a great starting point for beginners.
2. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/)<br>
Notice how in Fireship's video (specifically [1:09](https://youtu.be/sXQxhojSdZM?t=69)) they use some sort of tool to test out RegEx-es. Well, that tool is called RegExr! 
RegExr is (in my opinion) a great place to learn and practice one's Regular Expression (RegEx) skills.
The website allows you to create RegEx, see and understand how it is parsed, and test it against your input.
3. [Markdown Cheatsheet (by Adam Pritchard)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)<br>
A great quick reference sheet about Markdown, especially important since this semester there is more than one subject that uses Markdown.
It gives some syntax examples, as well as how they look after being rendered.

#### W02
1. [Chmod Quick Reference](https://quickref.me/chmod)<br>
This is a great quick reference sheet for learning about Linux's file and directory permission system, its octal notation, as well as how to manipulate them using the *chmod* command. It also has a very useful generator to calculate the octal notation for a certain permission.
Also, there are some *chmod* usage examples, as well as some common *chmod*s for things such as ```~/.ssh``` permissions (which i personally find very handy and saves a couple of Google searches).
2. [7 Cryptography Concepts EVERY Developer Should Know (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuyzuNBFWxQ)<br>
Yet another Fireship video, but this video does a good job at introducing some common yet important terms and concepts within cryptography and cybersecurity.
Highly recommended to watch, especially when one is totally new to cryptography concepts such as hashes and HMACs.
3. [Public Key Cryptography: RSA Encryption Algorithm (by Art of the Problem)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8)<br>
A great video which explains, in an intuitive and easy manner, the basics of asymmetric cryptography. 
I personally believe the video explains asymmetric cryptography in an interesting manner using a few intuitive examples, which should help one understand.
The later part of the video dives into the nitty gritty details of the RSA algorithm, if you are interested in that.

*More coming soon!*
