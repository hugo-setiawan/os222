#### W00
1. [Linux in 100 Seconds (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrB13utjYV4)<br>
I think this is an excellent video that explains, in an interesting and quick manner, what Linux (as an OS) is and able to do, as well as some basic commands such as *ls, pwd, du*, and many others. 
If you're totally new to Linux, i believe this is an excellent first video to watch (besides, it's only 3 minutes long!).  
2. [What is an Operating System as Fast as Possible (by Techquickie)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzRTmdd9j0)<br>
This video does a quick dive into what an OS generally does, like managing hardware and providing system calls.
In a sense, this video is able to summarize a bunch of concepts which are important in an OS into one, 5 minute video.
I recommend watching this to get a stronger grasp of the basic concepts.

#### W01
1. [Regular Expressions (RegEx) in 100 Seconds (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQxhojSdZM)<br>
Another video made by Fireship which i think explains the what a RegEx is and some basic syntax in a quick and easy to understand manner.
Although this video doesn't dive very deep into RegEx syntax, I still think it is a great starting point for beginners.
2. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/)<br>
Notice how in Fireship's video (specifically [1:09](https://youtu.be/sXQxhojSdZM?t=69)) they use some sort of tool to test out RegEx-es. Well, that tool is called RegExr! 
RegExr is (in my opinion) a great place to learn and practice one's Regular Expression (RegEx) skills.
The website allows you to create RegEx, see and understand how it is parsed, and test it against your input.
3. [Markdown Cheatsheet (by Adam Pritchard)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)<br>
A great quick reference sheet about Markdown, especially important since this semester there is more than one subject that uses Markdown.
It gives some syntax examples, as well as how they look after being rendered.

#### W02
1. [Chmod Quick Reference](https://quickref.me/chmod)<br>
This is a great quick reference sheet for learning about Linux's file and directory permission system, its octal notation, as well as how to manipulate them using the *chmod* command. It also has a very useful generator to calculate the octal notation for a certain permission.
Also, there are some *chmod* usage examples, as well as some common *chmod*s for things such as ```~/.ssh``` permissions (which i personally find very handy and saves a couple of Google searches).
2. [7 Cryptography Concepts EVERY Developer Should Know (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuyzuNBFWxQ)<br>
Yet another Fireship video, but this video does a good job at introducing some common yet important terms and concepts within cryptography and cybersecurity.
Highly recommended to watch, especially when one is totally new to cryptography concepts such as hashes and HMACs.
3. [Public Key Cryptography: RSA Encryption Algorithm (by Art of the Problem)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8)<br>
A great video which explains, in an intuitive and easy manner, the basics of asymmetric cryptography. 
I personally believe the video explains asymmetric cryptography in an interesting manner using a few intuitive examples, which should help one understand.
The later part of the video dives into the nitty gritty details of the RSA algorithm, if you are interested in that.

#### W03
1. [Linux Directories Explained in 100 Seconds (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)<br>
Yes, another Fireship video, but I think this video does a great job at explaining how devices and files are arranged in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) used by Linux.
It gives a detailed explanation of what each of the main directories' functions are as well as their contents.
2. [The Linux File System...for humans (by Engineer Man)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFIoRLqhFpo)<br>
If the previous video linked was a quick dive, this video is a deeper dive into the FHS structure used by Linux.
It explains the concept of pseudofiles (which may represent files and other things such as devices and pseudo-devices) as well as what each directory is supposed to do or contain.
3. [The Linux Storage Stack Diagram](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/File:Linux-storage-stack-diagram_v4.10.png)<br>
Ever wondered about how Linux handles calls related to storage access, as well as the various subsystems and parts used? Well look no further than the Linux Storage Stack Diagram!
Albeit the image is a bit intimidating and daunting at first sight, if you are interested in what it takes to handle storage within Linux, this is one easy way to visualize and figure it out.
4. [File Systems 2: File Allocation (by Jacob Schrum)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbHMDZTVrJg)<br>
This video describes the three main forms of of block-based file allocation in a visual manner. 
I think this video does a great job at explaining the allocation methods, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.

#### W04
1. [you will never ask about pointers again after watching this video (by Low Level Learning)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybLD6_2gKM) <br>
This video helps one to understand pointers in a simple manner. It tries to do that by decomposing complex, intimidating expressions such as `int* pX = &X;` into simple, understandable English. 
Besides this video, I also recommend viewing other videos made by the same channel to get a good grasp of low level concepts and programming. 
2. [Learn Makefiles (makefiletutorial.com)](https://makefiletutorial.com/) <br>
This is a great resource for learning all about Makefiles! It starts with the simplest Makefile syntax, then it gradually expands to cover more 'fancy' syntaxes. 
In doing so, it helps in learning Makefiles without being too overwhelmed by it.
