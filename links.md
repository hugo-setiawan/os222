1. [Linux in 100 Seconds (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrB13utjYV4)<br>
I think this is an excellent video that explains, in an interesting and quick manner, what Linux (as an OS) is and able to do, as well as some basic commands such as *ls, pwd, du*, and many others. 
If you're totally new to Linux, i believe this is an excellent first video to watch (besides, it's only 3 minutes long!).  
2. [What is an Operating System as Fast as Possible (by Techquickie)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzRTmdd9j0)<br>
This video does a quick dive into what an OS generally does, like managing hardware and providing system calls.
In a sense, this video is able to summarize a bunch of concepts which are important in an OS into one, 5 minute video.
I recommend watching this to get a stronger grasp of the basic concepts.

1. [Regular Expressions (RegEx) in 100 Seconds (by Fireship)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQxhojSdZM)<br>
Another video made by Fireship which i think explains the what a RegEx is and some basic syntax in a quick and easy to understand manner.
Although this video doesn't dive very deep into RegEx syntax, I still think it is a great starting point for beginners.
2. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/)<br>
Notice how in Fireship's video (specifically [1:09](https://youtu.be/sXQxhojSdZM?t=69)) they use some sort of tool to test out RegEx-es. Well, that tool is called RegExr! 
RegExr is (in my opinion) a great place to learn and practice one's Regular Expression (RegEx) skills.
The website allows you to create RegEx, see and understand how it is parsed, and test it against your input.
